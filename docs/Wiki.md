## Introduction

CacheQueuer Is a tool to Queue tasks easily and user friendly.

I got the motivation to do this project after countless hours spend trying to automatize tasks inside SideFx Houdini. The first plan was to make a Houdini specific "plugin" to manage the tasks but I realized that the program would be easy to make generic. So I designed the code with flexibility and scalability in mind and i hope that some day it will be may loyal companion whenever i need to automatize a process.
